I worked as an R&D Team Manager and Staff Engineer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent" target="_blank">Tencent</a> (2014-2018).
Previously I was a Team Leader and Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu" target="_blank">Baidu</a> (2012-2014), and a Software Engineer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei" target="_blank">Huawei</a> (2011-2012).
From these positions, I gained industry-level online product R&D experience in Data Mining, Applied Machine Learning, Large-Scale Distributed System, and Mobile Operating System Development. Additionally, I gained three years of engineering team management experience (10-20 SDEs).

Internet products which I worked for include: <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/sli" target="_blank">Tencent Cloud</a>, <a href="https://map.qq.com/" target="_blank">Tencent Maps</a>, <a href="https://tas.qq.com/" target="_blank">Tencent AI in Car</a>, <a href="https://www.tencent.com/en-us/system.html" target="_blank">Tencent Games</a>, <a href="https://map.baidu.com/" target="_blank">Baidu Maps</a>, <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/in/phones/" target="_blank">Huawei Smartphone</a>.

Beginning in fall 2018, I switched my career track from industry to academia. Now I am a Ph.D. student and Research Assistant in Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.usc.edu" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a>, Los Angeles, United States.
I am generally interested in Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Large-Scale Distributed System, and Mobile Operating System.
